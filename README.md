Project Name: Uthiru Waste Management Platform
Author: Medrine Mulindi

Project Discription
Project problem statement
There is lack of proper waste management in my area. The streets are often littered and heaps of uncollected garbage can be seen from time to time. This is a big health hazard to the people in my community. There are no proper garbage collection guidelines and the community members are inadequately educated on proper waste disposal and recycling.

Solution
I offer waste disposal services as well as educate the locals on proper waste management.

Project set up.
Follow these steps to set up this project.
    1. Clone this GitHub repository
    2. Run the command json-server  --watch db.json on your command line inside this repository to start the JSON data base.
    3. Open the index.html file in your browser.

Technologies used
    • Html for the basic web structure
    • CSS for styling the user interface
    • JavaScript for DOM manipulation, event handling and communicating with the server.
    • JSON DB Server to serve as the local API for storing schedule details.
    
Usage
    • When a user first visits the page, they see a waste collection schedule for their area. 
    • Request for a special garbage collection in case their garbage was not collected or they have    more garbage that they want to dispose. I only offer this service on Fridays,
    • Search for a specific day’s schedule by using the schedule’s id.
    • Delete a displayed schedule
    • View the resource section and interact with the resource by liking if they enjoyed it
	
Core deliverables
The key deliverables are
    1. Display the garbage collection schedule 
    2. Make a special request for garbage collection. This should persist to the server
    3. View and interact with the resources on the resource section
    4. Search for a specific schedule
    5. Delete a displayed schedule
